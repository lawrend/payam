PAYAM is an app wherein a user signs up and can create and participate in a Payam.

A Payam is a kind of poem. In a PAYAM, the first user picks a one-word title, selects a Style from a list (or creates a new style), then writes the first line that is between 10 and 20 words long.

A next "scribe" is selected at random from all users, who will then see only the title, the style, and last 5 words written by the previous scribe before adding their own line of 10-20 words.

After 8 scribes have written lines the completed Payam is viewable by everyone.

The decompose button will randomly and permanently remove one word from each line of a Payam. Each press of the button removes another word until there is only one word left in a line.

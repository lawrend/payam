PAYAM is an app wherein a user signs up and can create and participate in a Payam.

A PAYAM is a kind of poem. In a PAYAM, the first user picks a one-word title, selects a Style from a list (or creates a new style), then writes the first line that is between 10 and 20 words long.

A next "scribe" is selected at random from all users, who will then see only the title, the style, and last 5 words written by the previous scribe before adding their own line of 10-20 words.

After 8 scribes have written lines the completed PAYAM is viewable.

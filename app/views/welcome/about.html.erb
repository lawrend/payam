    <h3 id="base-purp">What is this thing?</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <p>This thing is a kind of game made popular by the surrealists in the 1920's. It has been referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse">"Exquisite Corpse"</a> and that is what I called this at first, but that was too ghoulish.</p>

    <h3 id="base-purp">Sure, not <span style="font-style: italic">Corpse,</span> but why <span style="font-style: italic">Payam?</span></h3>
    <div class="container">
      <p>Good question.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 id="base-purp">Thank You.</h4>
    <div class="container">
      <p>You are welcome.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 id="base-purp">Okay, will you just tell me?</h4>
    <div class="container">
      <p>Yes. I was looking for a word in a different language and so found this word which kind of means "message" but it's a bastardized spelling and I can't pronounce the orignial word nor can I actually spell it.</p>
